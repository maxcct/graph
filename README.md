# Graph

I wrote the methods `get_edge_list`, `get_adjacency_list`, `get_adjacency_matrix`,
`dfs_helper` and `bfs`, and altered the `__init__` and `insert_node` methods. The
rest of this code was provided as part of Udacity's _Technical Interview Practice_
course.

I'm uploading this to GitHub because the implementations I came up with for the
aforementioned methods were significantly more efficient than those subsequently
provided by Udacity as examples of a possible correct solution for each method.
